Predicting product cancelations for sales retention


**Changes to get the essay into a form that can be used for a reash paper submission**

## Notes
Azure is OK.
- Don't forget to describe data (a sample of data provided, say a row, should be described in the paper).
- ANN, do you mean classic neural networks or those classified for deep learning (I'll help in both, my guess is that we might go for a tensorflow implementation for a deep learning one — and I will do that) — give me a week time. 
- Cross-validation (for RF you don't need as randomization is per se a cross-validation approach), for the rest yes, sklearn provides the suitable libraries as in your link. 


- Frame the literature review into the kind of business you are dealing with, and its impact
The - impact of sale retention and the related impact of cancelation on businesses (an example?). 
- We need to relate to other works done on this dataset or similar ones — do we have?
- Expanding the algorithmic solution to include, for instance, Random Forests (and others, say, SVM, NBC) and I will help in Neural Networks. 
- Remove the justification and literature about ROC and evaluation methods — we’ll just use them and analyze the resulted curves. 
- Conclusions should relate to the obtained outcomes, mainly. Let’s not go far with coursework-specific items in all the document. 
- Cross validation is required for evaluation of algorithms — I will help in this

We need to relate to other works done on this dataset or similar ones — do we have?
> This dataset is actually from the company I work for, anonymised by me. I used it as I know the format really well. A brief look at existing papers:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014605/
This is interesting: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666835/
I’ll read these tomorrow and see if they apply to this problem.

> OK, I’ve started a new notepad: https://notebooks.azure.com/nathfy/libraries/paper and I’ll re-organise to include RF, SVM and NBC – Any pointers for NN would be great. If Azure is no good for sharing then let me know your preference.

> Makes sense
 
Conclusions should relate to the obtained outcomes, mainly. Let’s not go far with coursework-specific items in all the document.
> OK I’ve setup the document on here: https://v2.overleaf.com/3526875447bghttgtbhzvy with the correct LaTeX formatting, I’ll move the essay in and edit it there – you should be able to edit directly or add comments. I’ll work on this tomorrow evening and ping you with any updates.
 
Cross validation is required for evaluation of algorithms
>> Is sklearn the best way to do this? http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html
